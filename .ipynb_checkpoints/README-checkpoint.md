**Justification for License and code of conduct**
The license we created is called the Affero GPL. We selected this because it provides the most coverage. On the website https://snyk.io/learn/open-source-licenses/ , the diagram shows that this license checks off the most amount of features. It is always necessary to choose a license that provides ample protection for everyone who owns and contributes to the project.

The code of conduct we choose is specific to software engineers and this is relevant to this course. It emphasizes the importance of creating your own software designs and being considerate to others in your work atmosphere. This code of conduect also stresses collaboration and personal responsibility.
